The corn cheese is a must!',

The portions are fairly small, however this allows you to try many different things. The paneer tikka masala is a great vegetarian alternative and one of my favorites.',

I had heard a lot about a restaurant called Trattoria Il Panino and decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint! I had glass of wine paired with their lobster ravioli with crab meat sauce and it was delicious. One of my favorite meals that I have had in a long time. This restaurant will definitely be my go-to whenever I return to Boston.',
